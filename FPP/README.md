# Clifford Strong II - Final Project Proposal 

## My final project is going to be a trivia game, that will keep track of your points, and at the end will give you a reward / title depending on how many you got right or wrong

## This project will be a trivia game for facts about primates and other various animals in the monkey family. The game will be displayed through a popup box that will pose a randomized question to the viewer, and based upon the anwser the graphic will change to display if you got it right or wrong, and what your current score is. After a number of questions done right, you will receive a crown, and get to see a little animation of a monkey play. A short sweet simple trivia game, that gives you a reward at the end. 

### None of the work being done for this project will overlap with work done outside of class or for other classes. 
### For me a good outcome for this final project is having all of the basics of my outline finsihed and implimented such as the score system, the question box, and the reward. 
### A better outcome though, given that i have more time, is implimenting all the afformentioned things but making them sleaker and a more pleasant design. 
### The best possible outcome would be to have everything mentioned before, along with some new features to impliment such as special questions that maybe give you an effect like giving you hints or some sound desgin aspects to the mix. 

#TIMELINE
