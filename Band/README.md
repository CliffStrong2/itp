# Clifford Strong II - BAND in class HTML assignment 
## [Link to final website](https://cliffstrong2.github.io/)
### Making this website we ran into mostly problems of communication when it came to what each persons assigned task was for the project. One person thought that they were suppose to make a description for their markdown file, when they were actually tasked with making a description of the animal they had chosen for the project. I also had to guide Taylor through how to make changes to the CSS file so that we could have different fonts and colors, and how to link it to an HTML file. Other than that, the process was quite smooth. 

### My Contribution: My role at first was to assign who would do what, making sure that everyone in the group had something to do and work on. I decided to have my url be the host for the website, and for me to compile everything and write my description, the reviews on the page, and the begining description along with editing.

## Taylors contribution: Taylor was tasked with creating a CSS file for our website to change the color and fonts on the site, along with making the description for their animal. They cycled through a lot of different colors and font selections for the CSS file, and did a great job making sure everything was compiled correctly by asking questions and citing outside sources for different colors they could use. 

## Qi Yis Contribution: They were tasked with finding an audio file for our project, and creating the description for their project. They found the audio file very quick and were very communicative for airdropping it and sending me their description via email. They also came up with the idea of the zoo concept, having each of us assign ourselves an animal.

## Nates Contribution: Nate was tasked with finding an image to use for our website, along with making their animal description. They came in a little late, so it took a second to get them on track, but once they were they finished their tasks very fast and efficiently.
