# Clifford Strong II - Final Programming Assignment 
# Monkey Madness Trivia 

### This project is a simple trivia game in HTML that poses some questions for you to anwser. I started by using the .io website we did in class as a sort of template for how to approach this. I started by getting the questions ready, of which i prepared 5 of them. I then got the css file ready, and made sure to get the basics implemented for the body of the page, the questions, and the anwsers in terms of display. I then implemented all of the questions through a constant, that being trivia. I listed them all, and put the different available anwsers. My next challenge was i now needed a way of flipping through these different questions and anwsers. I did this by establishing two functions : loadQuestion and checkAnswer. Each one functions as described, though i had trouble figuring out how to properly use the button style commands BTN for short. After getting the hang of it, i further tweaked the functions, added a picture to the header, and had my game. 

### I ran into many many many difficulties doing this project though. Namely, i never was able to implement certain aspects that i wanted to such as the points system and the little gif and crown i wanted at the end. I knew how to implement them as static pieces, but having them occur after certain actions was something i just couldnt get down in a way i was happy with as it would always end up screwing something up, usually the transitions of the other questions to one another. I ran into another problem where for the longest time i didnt have the html file and the css file linked, and got upset that io just kept getting a white screen when i went to test it, but i eventually got that working as well.
