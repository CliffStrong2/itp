# Fahrenheit to Celsius Assignment 3 - Clifford Strong II
## For this assignment i was tasked with writing lines of code that would convert a value of fahrenheit (99) to Celsius
### I did this by reviewing the javascripot codealong, and trying out different things within the file to try and reach a result. I trial and errored it through the [elloquent javascript website](https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/) and eventually found the solution. 
### This assignment took me a massive amount of troubleshooting and debugging, despite the small scale of the code i was resulted with. I initially thought that i needed to make my varuables constants, so i was in a loop of making those constants and continually getting errors. I eventually figured out that i wouldnt be able to manipulate the variables if i kept them as constants, and therefore needed to assign them at let commands. another problem i ran into was with the math. I kept getting an error message for my code even though the math seemed right, though i later found out that i needed to add the * after the brackets in the multiplication problem. I assumed that the program would automatically know to divide it from there, but as i should have known from class, computers never properly assume logic. 
# [all code used was sourced from the github folder, and complied though trial and error](https://github.com/rdwrome/261fa25/blob/main/03Operators%26Bindings/codealong.js)
### Code used 
### `Let f = 99;`
### ` let c = (f - 32)*5/9`
### ` console.log(c.tofixed(5))`
