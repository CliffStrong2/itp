# Haiku Assignment 1 - Clifford Strong II
## For this assignment i programed my computer to make it read a haiku out loud via an audio file
### I did this by opening my terminal prompt on my computer, made super to direct myself to the correct folder on my computer, and then entered the comand to create an aiff file. I then comitted them to my itp folder, and sent it to github.
### The main issue i encountered while doing this was figuring out how to properly commit my work to github, as i had forgotten how to in class. I eventually figured it out though, as i hadent written a document reason before pushing. 
#### I only used code sourced from the class github link, under the [01git&shell](https://github.com/rdwrome/261fa25/tree/main/01Git%26Shell) section of the class folders.

### CODE USED `say "a raindrop from, the rooftop, fell in my beer" -o cliffordhaiku.aiff`
